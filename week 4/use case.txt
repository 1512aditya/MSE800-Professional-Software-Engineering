The purpose of this database is to efficiently manage academic information by organizing data about students, teachers, and courses within a YOOBEE College. The Student entity stores essential details such as student IDs and names, ensuring that each student is uniquely identifiable. The Teacher entity captures teacher information through unique IDs and names, establishing responsibility for teaching various courses. The Course entity contains course IDs and names, linking each course to the teacher who instructs it. Relationships are clearly defined: teachers can teach multiple courses, and students can enroll in many courses, which is managed through an enrollment relationship. This database provides a structured framework to track who teaches which course and which students are enrolled, supporting academic administration and reporting needs.
